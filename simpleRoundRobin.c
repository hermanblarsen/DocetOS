#include "simpleRoundRobin.h"

/* This is an implementation of an extremely simple (and inefficient!) round-robin scheduler.

   An array of pointers to TCBs is declared, and when tasks are added they are inserted into
	 this array.  When tasks finish, they are removed from the array (pointers are set back to
	 zero).  When the scheduler is invoked, it simply looks for the next available non-zero
	 pointer in the array, and returns it.  If there are no non-zero TCB pointers in the array,
	 a pointer to the idle task is returned instead.
	 
	 The inefficiency in this implementation arises mainly from the way arrays are used for list
	 storage.  If the array is large and the number of tasks is small, the scheduler will spend
	 a lot of time looking through the array each time it is called. */
