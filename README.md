# DocetOS

A small and incomplete RTOS developed through teaching and assignments at the University of York.

## Assignment Brief:
Task: To modify DocetOS to increase its functionality.

Features must include:
+ An efficient fixed-priority scheduler
+ A queue-based task communication system

Must also include at least TWO of the following:
+ A memory pool implementation, properly protected by mutexes
+ Support for code that uses the floating-point unit (FPU)
+ A more efficient sleep/wait mechanism

Optionally, to make your design more useful, you may implement more than two of the
features from the list above, or change or extend any other features of the operating
system as you see fit.

The implementation details of the features are entirely up to the developer, but should ensure
avoidance of race conditions, efficient use of CPU time and RAM, and to a sensible, readable code structure.
